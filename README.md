# Handwritten-Digit-Classification-using-CNN-and-ViT

This project implements a deep learning application for classifying handwritten digit strings using a Vision Transformer (ViT) model. Unlike traditional models that classify single digits, this application supports multi-digit string recognition directly from user input.
